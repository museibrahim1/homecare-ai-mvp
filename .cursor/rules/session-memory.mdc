## Key Decisions
- ADL Logging stays on web app for providers (was briefly removed, then re-added)
- Resend stays — no PHI in emails, no migration needed
- Twilio removed from stack entirely
- No EIN field encryption needed (not doing EVS)
- Vanta too expensive for now — doing DIY HIPAA compliance
- Mobile companion app planned (React Native/Expo) for caregivers (clock in/out, ADL logging) and agencies (assessments, caregiver tracking)
- Status page created for downtime updates (like Airtable's)
- Contract system has both pipeline-generated and standalone creation paths

## Sidebar Navigation Structure
- Dashboard, Deals Pipeline, Leads, My Schedule
- All Clients, Assessments, Care Tracker, ADL Logging, Policies & Renewals
- Team Chat
- Proposals, Create Contract, OCR Templates, Documents
- Reports, Help & Support, Team Members, Billing
- Activity Monitor, Integrations, Settings
- Admin section: Dashboard, Approvals, Subscriptions, Stripe Config, Compliance, Support, Audit Logs, Platform Users, System Health, Status Page

## Known Issues / Technical Debt
- Page bouncing when clicking sidebar nav items (was reported, needs verification)
- Contract preview had multiple issues (fixed: service text placement, phone duplication, dollar signs, policy styling, signature fields)
- useRequireAuth() returns { isLoading } not { loading }
- Set iteration needs Array.from(new Set(...)) for TypeScript downlevelIteration
