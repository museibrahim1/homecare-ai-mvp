# Auto-Commit Rule for AI Voice Contractor

## CRITICAL: Commit Changes Frequently

After making significant code changes (more than a few lines), ALWAYS commit to git to prevent data loss.

### Commit Triggers
- After creating or modifying any file
- After completing any feature or fix
- Before ending a session
- Every 10-15 minutes during active development

### Commit Command Pattern
```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "Description of changes"
```

### Why This Matters
- Cursor chat sessions are ephemeral - code changes can be lost
- Docker containers may have different code than local filesystem  
- Uncommitted code costs money to regenerate

### Quick Commit Messages
- "WIP: feature-name" for work in progress
- "Add: feature description" for new features
- "Fix: bug description" for bug fixes
- "Update: component/file name" for modifications

## Auto-Save Script
Run `./scripts/auto_commit.sh` to automatically commit any pending changes.
