  ONE FOUNDING PRINCIPLE — READ THIS EVERY MONDAY
================================================================================

  Palmcare wins by making homecare agencies more profitable
  faster than any other tool on the market.

  Every product decision, every sale, every marketing move
  should answer one question:

        "Does this help a homecare agency get to revenue faster?"

  If yes — prioritize it.
  If no  — cut it or defer it.

  From beta to $200K MRR, your only job is sequencing.
  Do the thing that removes the biggest risk this week.
  Then do the next thing.
